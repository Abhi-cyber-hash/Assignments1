        "\n",
        "**Ans.** The five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Encapsulation** – This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit known as a class. It helps protect the data from outside interference and misuse by restricting access through private and public access modifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Abstraction** – Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary features or interfaces to the user. It simplifies interactions with complex systems by showing only essential information and leaving out the unnecessary complexities.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Inheritance** – Inheritance allows a new class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (methods) from an existing class (called a superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Polymorphism** – Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, and methods can behave differently based on the object calling them (e.g., method overloading or overriding).\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Composition** – Composition is a design principle where one object is composed of one or more objects from other classes. It implies a \"has-a\" relationship (as opposed to inheritance, which represents an \"is-a\" relationship) and allows for more flexible and modular designs.\n",
        "\n",
        "These concepts work together to make code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain."

The MRO is crucial in cases of multiple inheritance, where a class inherits from more than one class. Python uses the MRO to determine which method to call when there are methods with the same name in multiple classes.\n",
